# Amazon Stock Forecast RNN(LSTM, GRU, Simple RNN)

## Introduction
This project aims to perform forecasting of Amazon (AMZN) stock prices using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based approach, including the following models:

- Simple RNN

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

The primary focus of the prediction is on daily closing price data (Close), which is commonly used in technical analysis of stock markets.

## Dataset Overview

![Amazon stock price](images/Closed%20Amazon.png)

The AMZN stock remained below $5 until 2009, began increasing steadily to $25 by 2016, and surged to $180 during the COVID-19 pandemic before correcting to under $100 in 2023.

## Data Splitting
To train and evaluate the models properly, we split the dataset as follows:

- 80% Training Data: Used to train the model.

- 20% Testing Data: Used to evaluate the model‚Äôs generalization ability on unseen data.

From the 80% training data:

- We further divide it using TimeSeriesSplit Cross Validation, which respects the temporal order of the data to prevent data leakage.

- In each split, earlier data is used for training and later data for validation.

- This approach simulates a real-world scenario where future data should never influence past predictions.

This ensures a robust evaluation while maintaining the integrity of time series modeling.

## Model Architectures
- Simple RNN: Basic RNN layer; suffers from vanishing gradient in long sequences.

- LSTM: Uses input, forget, and output gates to retain long-term dependencies.

- GRU: Simplified version of LSTM with update and reset gates; often faster and equally effective.

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE: Penalizes large errors more heavily.

- MAE: Measures average absolute error.

- MAPE: Measures percentage error, useful for cross-scale comparison.

## üìâ Loss Comparison
![Graph Loss](images/Graph%20Loss.png)
All models show comparable loss values. However, deeper evaluation requires considering RMSE, MAE, and MAPE

---

## üìä Model Performance
![Comparation Model](images/Comparation%20Model.png)

GRU outperforms other models in all three metrics, indicating it generalizes best to the test data.

---

## üîÅ Cross Validation (TimeSeriesSplit)
Traditional K-Fold isn't ideal for time series due to data leakage. We use TimeSeriesSplit, which respects chronological order.

![Comparation Model CV](images/Comparation%20Model%20CV.png)

GRU again shows the best performance on both training and validation sets, reinforcing its robustness.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Evaluation
![Actual vs Predicted](images/Actual%20vs%20Predicted%20GRU.png)

The GRU model closely follows the actual values in the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal patterns.

---

## üìö Conclusion
GRU delivers the best forecasting performance for AMZON stock prices among the RNN-based models tested. This solution highlights the importance of model selection and evaluation strategy in time series forecasting.
